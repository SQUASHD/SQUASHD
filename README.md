# 👋 Hi, I'm Dan

🎾 Background: At university, I balanced studying mathematics with playing squash semi-competitively (hence the profile name), but I found that I like solving problems in code rather than on paper, so I've been all in on programming for the last few years.

👨‍💻 Coding Path: Learned the basics first with Python. Moved onto frontend where I discovered my problem-child, TypeScript. My first repo was a basic HTML page, but even that simple little thing struck a chord. Later, I shifted to backend, delving into C# and ASP.NET Core.

🔍 Current Focus: After a year in frontend development, I've returned to backend programming. Now it's Go, or no go (hah!)
