# 👋 Hi, I'm Dan

🎾 Background: At university, I balanced studying mathematics with playing squash semi-competitively (hence the profile name). Since then I've pivoted towards programming.

👨‍💻 Coding Experience: I made my first "hello world" In August 2022 when I started pursuing a vocational degree in Backend Programming. My [first repo](https://github.com/SQUASHD/odin-recipes) was a basic HTML page, but even that simple little thing struck a chord.

🔍 Current Focus: After a year in frontend development, I've returned to backend programming. Now it's Go, or no go (hah!)
